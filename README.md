## Learning Objectives

```sh
This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

- Running tests from the command line
- Using common middleware packages
- Receiving requests through routes
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
- Building an API following RESTful design principles
- Writing custom middleware functions

You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.
```

## Project Rubric 
```sh
For your project to pass, all of the following statements must be true.

- All middleware and handler functions have a single responsibility and are named functions.
- All data passed between middleware and handler functions uses response.locals.
- All chained method calls on a route(...) end with all(methodNotAllowed).
- All update handlers guarantee that the id property of the stored data cannot be overwritten.
```
